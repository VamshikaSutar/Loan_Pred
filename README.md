Welcome to the Loan Repayment Prediction project! 
This project aims to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to repay the loan based on various features and historical data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we strive to provide a valuable tool for financial institutions to assess and manage loan risks effectively.

Project Overview
Objective: Develop a predictive model for loan repayment using machine learning algorithms.
Data Source: Utilized a comprehensive dataset containing historical loan information and repayment outcomes.
Methodology: Implemented feature engineering, data preprocessing, and employed popular machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for predictive modeling.
